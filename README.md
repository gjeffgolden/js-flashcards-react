# JavaScript Flashcards

I created this app to help myself and other early-career frontend developers get more familiar with fundamentals, key terms and common algorithm methods. Using paper flashcards was an immense help to internalizing these concepts for me, and it seemed like a fun challenge to turn them into a web app.

## Challenges

1. Card shuffling
2. Cycling forward and backward through each card deck
3. Implementing on-hover functionality using React's synthetic events instead of CSS
4. Nailing down concise, correct definitions and helpful examples
